23/03/25 - started the project, having some issues getting my head around tailwind and positioning.

29/03/25 - will start working on building out the page routing, made some progress on setting up pages. feeling a bit behind on progress. must improve on my functions and understanding how to write reusable code

01/04/25 - added tiptap so we've got a rich text editor in the project. tiptap floating menu now works functionally, bullet-pointed list needs some fixing and i need to add hover states for the menu. 

i think i'll add word count next, then start working on setting the editor up to create database entries once a user creates a post longer than 4 characters + title.

i'd like to add a wordcounter before i go to sleep, currently 2:09 am
