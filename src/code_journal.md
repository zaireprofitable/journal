23/03/25 - started the project, having some issues getting my head around tailwind and positioning.

29/03/25 - will start working on building out the page routing, made some progress on setting up pages. feeling a bit behind on progress. must improve on my functions and understanding how to write reusable code

01/04/25 - added tiptap so we've got a rich text editor in the project. tiptap floating menu now works functionally, bullet-pointed list needs some fixing and i need to add hover states for the menu. 

i think i'll add word count next, then start working on setting the editor up to create database entries once a user creates a post longer than 4 characters + title.

i'd like to add a wordcounter before i go to sleep, currently 2:09 am. yea maybe not. refer to this chat tomorrow so you can implement this feature to the app: https://claude.ai/share/053d9330-e276-4bc0-8043-0bcdebde8b4d

same day, just not at midnight

fixed the floating menu hover state, the colors, and positioning, everything works now. made some tweaks to the styling for the editor, need to clean up the focus state

-- making the publish button dynamic.

started learning some basics around state variables [https://claude.ai/share/b70b8e20-79cf-4b9c-824f-18f54c76e9a3]

my interpretation is we use them so our program can use memory to intuitively understand when something is updated in the app. this saves us having to create multiple functions to take information from one function, storing it and creating another function to utilise said information

"Grade: A"

02/04/25 - working on data storage for the journal entries

2:01am kinda messed up the code. trying to use local storage temorarily and it's just turned into a shitshow tbf. in over my head, need to scale things down it feel.

pretty frustrated today, learning things but also on the other side of the Dunning-Kruuger effect where i'm realizing there's just so much i don't understand yet and it feels fucking draining at this point. going to see how i can improve my competency tomorrow/today.

i had a call with izaac which made things pretty clear. my dilemma was i kept trying to write code using my mind and referring to syntax and stuff i knew off the top of my head. i'd try this as i could roughly understand the logic, but applying the logic in the IDE just felt so difficult, i'd realize i don't know how to write out functions well or anything even though my theory knowledge could pass... 

he basically told me to stop worrying about all of that. ai does it for people these days, focus on understanding what's happening instead. writing syntax isn't effective unless you're doing something like a live coding interview in person... even then i'm focused more on bringing my projects to life, maybe getting a job to learn how to apply ux to fe work...

anyways, i'll keep turning up even if it takes a year.

been playing around with some styling, think i've fixed some of the consistency issues in the editor.
